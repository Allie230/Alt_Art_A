<main>
  
<h2>Do you have commission slots available?</h2>
 
<p>Boi I got a job and I'm a full time student... so no.</p>
<br>
<h2>Are prints available of you works? </h2>
<p>Nope.I actually did have prints of soe of my pieces for sale and they may still be out there, but short story short I don't have any ore pieces for sale.</p>
<br>
<h2>Is this a site just for viewing your work?</h2>
<p>Pretty much! In the future it'll be a great source for creating a portfolio.</p>
  
<br>
<h2>Why don't you just use instagram instead?</h2>
<p>First of all I do have an Instagram, one that I don't use. I will eventually when I have more free time. This website also provides organization and photo quality that instagram just can't.</p>
